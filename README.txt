Code Description
I connected the red led to 7, the yellow led to 6 and the green led to 5. 
I called DecideLight class in loop. 
I performed the controls of the LEDs in the DecideLight class I created. 
At first, the yellow led lights up for 3 seconds, then the yellow led turns off and the red led turns on. 
After the red led that lights up for 5 seconds, both the red and yellow leds turn on for 2 seconds. 
Finally, the red and yellow led turn off and only the green led turns on.
